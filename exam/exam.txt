    1. SQL - Structured Query Language. SQL is a language used to communicate with databases.
        It is used to query, insert, update, and delete data in a database.
        SQL is a standard language for storing, manipulating and retrieving data in databases.

        1.1. Example:

                CREATE TABLE table_name (
                    column1 datatype,
                    column2 datatype,
                    column3 datatype,
                    ....
                );
                SELECT column_name FROM table_name;
                SELECT * FROM table_name;  # Selects all rows from a table
                SELECT column_name FROM table_name WHERE condition;  # Selects only the rows that satisfy the condition
                SELECT column_name FROM table_name LIMIT number;  # Selects only the first number of rows
                SELECT column_name FROM table_name WHERE condition LIMIT number;  # Selects only the first number of rows that satisfy the condition
                INSERT INTO table_name (column1, column2, column3, ...) VALUES (value1, value2, value3, ...);  # Inserts a row into a table
                UPDATE table_name SET column1 = value1, column2 = value2, ... WHERE condition;  # Updates rows in a table
                DELETE FROM table_name WHERE condition;  # Deletes rows from a table

        1.2. In Usage:

                CREATE TABLE FRUITS (
                    ID INT PRIMARY KEY NOT NULL,
                    NAME TEXT NOT NULL,
                    PRICE INT NOT NULL
                );

                INSERT INTO FRUITS (ID, NAME, PRICE) VALUES (1, 'Apple', 100);
                INSERT INTO FRUITS (ID, NAME, PRICE) VALUES (2, 'Orange', 150);
                INSERT INTO FRUITS (ID, NAME, PRICE) VALUES (3, 'Banana', 200);

                SELECT * FROM FRUITS;

                UPDATE FRUITS SET PRICE = 250 WHERE ID = 3;

                DELETE FROM FRUITS WHERE ID = 2;

    2. Web scraping is a technique to automatically access and extract large amounts of information from a website,
        which can save a huge amount of time and effort. Web scraping is a technique to automatically access
        and extract large amounts of information from a website, which can save a huge amount of time and effort.

        2.1. Example:

                import requests  # to get the html
                from bs4 import BeautifulSoup  # pip install bs4
                url = 'https://www.example.com'  # url
                response = requests.get(url)  # get the html
                soup = BeautifulSoup(response.text, 'html.parser')  # parse the html
                print(soup.prettify())  # print the html

        2.2. In Usage:

                import requests
                from bs4 import BeautifulSoup

                url = 'https://www.stadion.uz'
                response = requests.get(url)
                soup = BeautifulSoup(response.text, 'html.parser')

                logo = soup.find('div', {'id': 'logo_container'})
                logo_img = logo.find('img')
                print(logo_img['src'])

    3. Regular expressions are a sequence of characters that define a search pattern.
        When you search for data in a text, you can use this search pattern to describe what you are searching for.
        A regular expression can be a single character, or a more complicated pattern.
        Regular expressions can be used to perform all types of text search and text replace operations.

        3.1. Example/In Usage:

                import re  # pip install regex
                text = "The rain in Spain"  # any text
                x = re.search("^The.*Spain$", text)  # search for a string that starts with "The" and ends with "Spain"
                if (x):  # condition
                  print("YES! We have a match!")
                else:
                  print("No match")
